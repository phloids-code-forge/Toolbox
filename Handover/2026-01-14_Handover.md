# Session Journal: 2026-01-14
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-14T00:38:00-06:00
**Session ID**: 2026-01-14_BRANDING_FIX

## ✅ Accomplished
- **Operation Lowercase**: Executed a global find/replace to strictly enforce 'phloid' (lowercase) branding across the UI (Header, Tooltips, Landing Page) and Changelog.
- **The Capitalization Incident**: Logged in the changelog as a humorous nod to the user's preference.
- **Handover Protocol**: Formalized the shutdown process to ensure no files are left behind this time.

## 🚧 Left Hanging
- **Nationwide View**: The map expansion is still pending implementation.
- **The University**: Content expansion for weather metrics is queued.
- **RadarEmbed**: Needs refactoring for dynamic local city pages.
- **Handover Automation**: Added to the task list but not yet scripted.

## 😤 Hassles
- **Late Start**: Session began with a handover deficit (missing files from previous session), which had to be manually addressed in the diary.
