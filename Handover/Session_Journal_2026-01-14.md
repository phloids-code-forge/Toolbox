# Session Journal: 2026-01-14
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-14T00:38:00-06:00
**Session ID**: 2026-01-14_BRANDING_FIX

## ✅ Accomplished
- **Operation Lowercase**: Executed a global find/replace to strictly enforce 'phloid' (lowercase) branding across the UI (Header, Tooltips, Landing Page) and Changelog.
- **The Capitalization Incident**: Logged in the changelog as a humorous nod to the user's preference.
- **Handover Protocol**: Formalized the shutdown process to ensure no files are left behind this time.

## 🚧 Left Hanging
- **Nationwide View**: The map expansion is still pending implementation.
- **The University**: Content expansion for weather metrics is queued.
- **RadarEmbed**: Needs refactoring for dynamic local city pages.
- **Handover Automation**: Added to the task list but not yet scripted.

## 😤 Hassles
- **Late Start**: Session began with a handover deficit (missing files from previous session), which had to be manually addressed in the diary.

# Session 2: The Triple Threat (Evening)
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-14T19:00:00-06:00
**Session ID**: 2026-01-14_TRIPLE_THREAT

## ✅ Accomplished
- **Ticker Refactor**: Implemented "Deck Shuffle" (no repeats), unified colors, and fixed the animation loop.
- **Nationwide Expansion**: Created `/nationwide` route and `USMap` component scaffold.
- **System Defense**: Created `scripts/validate_handover.py` to AUTOMATE the shutdown check.

## 🚧 Left Hanging
- **Map Data**: The US Map is currently a static placeholder ("Satellite Uplink Pending"). Needs real API data.
- **Socket Strategy**: The architectural rewrite was deferred to keep momentum on features.

## 😤 Hassles
- **None**: Smooth sailing. We stopped at a perfect "Save Point".
