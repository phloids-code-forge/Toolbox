**Session:** "Rosewood Studio Launch"

## What Happened

Today we launched a new project for **ezzackly** — phloid's fiber artist partner. Built an entire studio toolkit in one lunch break, then expanded it in the evening session.

The aesthetic brief was "Dusty Rose & Champagne" with ASMR interactions. Executed with glass morphism, Playfair Display typography, and Web Audio API for click sounds. Six tools deployed: Sentro Sizer, Graphgan Generator, Zen Counter, Hook Chart, Abbreviation Decoder, Gauge Converter.

The Graphgan Generator is the standout — drag-drop image upload, canvas-based pixelation with color quantization, and a color legend showing stitch counts. Client-side only, no server upload needed.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Web Audio API > external audio files** for simple sounds. Generate waveforms on-the-fly, zero hosting.
2. **Canvas API pixelation** is surprisingly simple. Draw at target size, sample pixels, quantize colors.
3. **PowerShell hates `&&`** — split git commands or use `;` instead.

## Next Build: Flameborn Garden

An Enshrouded farming simulator layered over the productivity tools. User plants crops, timers run in real-time matching game values. Features weather graphics and ASMR harvest sounds. Full spec documented.
