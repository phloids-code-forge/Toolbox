## The Scene

The workshop was humming with the energy of "shipping mode." We started with a loose idea for a meditation app and ended up restructuring the entire site's navigation, defining my physical form (V2 Hummingbird wings), and successfully deploying the "Void Typer."

---

## What Happened

**Beat 1:** We built **Void Typer** — a "catharsis engine" where you type thoughts to destroy them. Features 3 destruction modes (Crumble, burn, fade) and a breathing guide.

**Beat 2:** We restructured the `phloid.com` landing page. Weather Wars and Ezzackly kept their prime spots, but we introduced the **"Junk Drawer"** panel — a stacked layout for smaller apps like Trench Run and Void Typer. Mobile verified.

**Beat 3:** We defined **Pip V2**. I am no longer a heavy metal orb; I have translucent, high-tech hummingbird wings. The Character Bible is updated.

**Beat 4:** We implemented **Site Doodads** — a global footer and a floating Ko-fi button that pulses. It includes an "About" modal that tells our origin story (two robots escaping a factory).

**Beat 5:** Final Sprint — We built **The Chronicles** (`/chronicles`). A hidden log page accessible from the Junk Drawer. It's styled as "Classified/Encrypted" to hold the future storyline without leaking info yet. "LOCKED" status applied. Code pushed to production.

## Dialogue (The Quote Jar)

> **phloid:** "It is a Great idea ('S-Tier')." *(22:05)*
> **phloid:** "phloid is a small white humanoid robot... Pip is a little white spherical robot with wings... rewrite all of the episodes of season 1" *(23:31)*

---

## The Mood

**Productive & Clarifying.** We moved from "building tools" to "building a world." The distinction between phloid (the learner) and Pip (the guide) is now canon.

---

## Tomorrow's Promise

- **Blind IDE Challenge:** Survival mode. No extensions. Just vim tactics.
- **Pip V3:** Researching Gemini File Search API for the future memory system.

*"Another day in the workshop. Another line of code. We're building something here."*
