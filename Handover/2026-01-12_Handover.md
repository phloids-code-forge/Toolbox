# 🛑 SESSION SHUTDOWN PROTOCOL
**System Timestamp:** 2026-01-12 10:32

## ✅ ACCOMPLISHED (The Wins)
1.  **phloid Design Finalized (V9):**
    - **Visuals:** "Tough Cute" base, chunky boots, sleek ear panels (no gears), matte white finish.
    - **Mechanism:** Retractable "Brow" panel defined. **Angry state** strictly uses the same panel geometry as neutral state (consistency lock).
    - **Assets:** Turnaround Sheet, Expression Sheet, and Mechanism Detail showing consistent geometry.

2.  **Concept Art Gallery System:**
    - Created `Assets/Concepts/Sessions/` (Session-based storage).
    - Created `Assets/Concepts/Keepers/` (Permanent storage).
    - Built `gallery_gen.py`: Auto-generates `index.html` dark-mode gallery with lightbox.
    - **Status:** Operational & Live.

3.  **Weather Command CLI Mode:**
    - Added `--cli` flag to `weather.py`. Fixed Windows Unicode encoding.

4.  **Infrastructure Hardening (Pip OS v7.3):**
    - Initialized Git, created `config.json`, generated `requirements.txt`.
    - Project Ecosystem mapped & prioritized (**Cinematic Sleep Stories** = #1).

5.  **Documentation:**
    - created `Experts/10_The_Sculptor.md`.
    - created `Characters/phloid_bible.md` (Sources of Truth).

## 🚧 LEFT HANGING (Next Session)
1.  **Winter Night Scene:** Setup Blender project for the flagship Sleep Story.
2.  **Web Presence:** Register domain (phloid.com?) + host on Vercel (User to buy domain/hosting).
3.  **GitHub Remote:** Connect local repo to private GitHub repo for backup.

## 😤 HASSLES (Fixed)
- **Asset Loss:** Intermediate file copy commands failed/cancelled. Recovered all critical "Keeper" assets manually.
- **API Limits:** Hit rate limits on image gen, handled with wait time.
- **Git:** Fixed PowerShell `&&` syntax error.

## 🧠 PSYCHOMETRIC LOG
- **User Temperament:** **High Precision/Direct.** Knows exactly what they want (V8 paneling, specific seam placement).
- **Collaborative Friction:** **Low.** Iteration loop was tight and productive.
- **Wins:** The "Gallery" idea was a great addition for visual project management.
