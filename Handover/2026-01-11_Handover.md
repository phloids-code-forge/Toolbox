# 🛑 SESSION SHUTDOWN PROTOCOL
**System Timestamp:** 2026-01-11 22:06

## ✅ ACCOMPLISHED (The Wins)
1.  **Weather Command v2 (God Mode):**
    - Built a robust, local-first GUI (`weather.py`) with CustomTkinter.
    - Features: 10-Day Forecast, NWS Severe Alerts, Threaded Loading.
    - **Smart Golden Hour:** Added dynamic morning/evening logic.
2.  **RAG System Initialization (cns.py v7.1):**
    - Upgraded the Kernel to support **Long-Term Memory**.
    - **Read:** `python cns.py expert read [name]`
    - **Write:** `python cns.py expert create [name]`
3.  **Cognitive Infrastructure (The Team):**
    - Staffed the Agency with 9 Specialized Personas in `/Experts`.
    - **Core:** Architect, Scribe.
    - **Creative:** Visionary, Virtuoso.
    - **Business:** Strategist, Polyglot.
    - **Support:** Researcher, Tutor.

## 🚧 LEFT HANGING (Next Session)
1.  **Project: "The Truth in Weather"**: Shelved. Needs `auditor_bot.py` and SQLite setup.
2.  **Expert Tuning**: The templates are V1. We may need to add "Tools" and "Procedures" sections to them later.

## 😤 HASSLES (Fixed)
- **Windows Unicode Error:** Patched `cns.py` and `weather.py` to force UTF-8.
- **API 400 Error:** Removed invalid `time` parameter from Open-Meteo call.
- **GUI Crash:** Fixed `golden_title` AttributeError during UI updates.

## 🧠 PSYCHOMETRIC LOG
- **User Temperament:** **Evolving.** Started skeptical/annoyed ("You bugged me to death"). Shifted to Amazement ("OMG") upon Weather v2 delivery. Ended with High Trust ("You sold me").
- **Collaborative Friction:** **High Start -> Zero End.** The initial friction regarding "Antigravity" vs "Just coding" was resolved by demonstrating the value of the RAG system.
- **Wins:** The "Aha!" moment when the User realized RAG = Long Term Memory.
