# Welcome to PiPos OS (Obsidian Edition)

> "A place for everything, and everything in its place."

I have organized your vault to help you stay sane as we scale. Here is how to use it:

## The System (P.A.R.A + I)

### 📥 **Inbox**
*   **What goes here?** messy thoughts, "Untitled" notes, quick pastes.
*   **The Rule:** Dump it here now, file it later.
*   **Status:** I moved your `Untitled.md` files here.

### 🏗️ **Projects** (Actionable)
*   **What goes here?** Things with a deadline or a goal.
*   **Example:** `Weather Wars Web App`, `New Character Design`.
*   *Note: Your `web` folder lives in the root because code needs to compile, but you can link to it here.*

### 🏔️ **Areas** (Ongoing)
*   **What goes here?** Responsibilities with no deadline.
*   **Examples:** 
    *   `Characters/` (Your cast list)
    *   `Experts/` (Your persona database)
    *   `Dashboard.md` (Your overview)

### 📚 **Resources** (Reference)
*   **What goes here?** Things you want to learn or reference.
*   **New Addition:** `The_Library/` containing `Architecture_101.md`.

### 📓 **Journal** (Time-based)
*   **What goes here?** Daily notes, meeting logs, random ideas by date.
*   **Tip:** Turn on "Daily Notes" in Obsidian settings to autopopulate this.

### 🏛️ **Archives** (Cold Storage)
*   **What goes here?** Old stuff you don't need right now but might need later.
*   **Status:** I moved `Concept Art.md` here (since we have a folder for that now).

## ⚡ Quick Tips
1.  **CTRL+O:** Quickly open any file (fuzzy search).
2.  **[[Link]]:** Type `[[` to link to any other note.
3.  **Tags:** Use `#todo` or `#research` to tag blocks.

*Now go build something cool.*
