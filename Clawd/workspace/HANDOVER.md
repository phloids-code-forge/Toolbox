## ➡️ Suggested Next Steps

1. **Move to #pip-os channel** for Pip OS discussions
2. **Hand IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to AG** for Weather Wars coding
3. **TTS research** when ready (ElevenLabs recommended)

## 🔑 Context for Next Session

- phloid is new to coding — needs guidance, not assumptions
- Backup is now working (Google Drive syncing PiPos)
- Git commits should happen at end of every session
- Channel matters: #weather-wars for WW, #pip-os for Pip OS
