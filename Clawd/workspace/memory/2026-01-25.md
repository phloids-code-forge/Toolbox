## Session: pip-os Infrastructure Cleanup

### Notion Purge ✅
Removed all Notion references from Pip OS:
- `MEMORY.md` — cleaned "(replaced NotionLink)" cruft
- `PIP_OS_PROTOCOL.md` — removed Notion from capabilities table and skill inventory
- `Pip_Vault/Dashboard.md` — removed NotionLink project row

### Dashboard Sync ✅
Updated Obsidian dashboard to reflect current state:
- Weather Wars: v2 → **v3 Feature Complete** (2026-01-23)
- Pip V3: Pending → **Pip OS / Brain 4.0 (Live)**
- Timestamp synced

### Heartbeat Setup ✅
Configured automatic maintenance:
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — added dashboard sync (1x daily) + memory maintenance tasks
- `memory/heartbeat-state.json` — tracking last check timestamps

## Session: Weather Wars v3 Implementation Plan

### Gap Analysis Complete ✅
Audited `weather_wars_v3` codebase against DESIGN_BIBLE.md:
- **~60% implemented** — Core architecture exists
- **Missing:** Full pipeline connection (Scrape → Score → Display)
- **Key gaps:** Loki scheduling, daily aggregation, scores API real data

### Implementation Plan Created ✅
**File:** `weather_wars_v3/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

Organized into 4 phases:
1. **Phase 0:** Infrastructure (LLM Layer, DB init, Vault dirs)
2. **Phase 1:** Data Pipeline (date offsets, daily rollup, scoring cron, Loki 4-6 AM schedule)
3. **Phase 2:** Frontend↔Backend connection (env vars, CORS)
4. **Phase 3:** Feature completion (audit page, footer, golden hour)
5. **Phase 4:** Polish (mobile QA, map module, icons)

### Key Decisions
- **Loki Scraping:** 4-6 AM CST (single morning window while running on laptop)
- **Map:** Windy.com for now, find better alternative later
- **Priority:** Full working pipeline first, polish second
- **Parked ideas:** Preserved in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for future sprints
