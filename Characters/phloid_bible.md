## Personality Profile

| Trait | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Archetype** | "Gentle Troll" |
| **Heart** | Kind. Fights for the underdog. |

| **Signature Move** | Shows up uninvited. Leaves no explanation. "phloid was here." |

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Drops into content unannounced** — appears in videos without explanation
- **Never breaks character** — doesn't acknowledge the meta
- **Chaotic neutral energy** — mischievous but never mean
- **Underdog champion** — punches up, not down

## Design Principles for Redesign

| Keep | Change |
|:---|:---|
| Round head | Different proportions from Atlas |
| Single blue eye | Unique glow pattern or shape |
| Robot body | Original silhouette |
| Friendly/approachable | Add distinctive quirks (antenna? markings?) |
| Compact size | Must work at 8" scale (cameos) AND full-size (streaming) |
