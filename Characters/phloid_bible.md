- **Chaotic neutral energy** — mischievous but never mean
- **Underdog champion** — punches up, not down

## Design Principles for Redesign

| Keep | Change |
|:---|:---|
| Round head | Different proportions from Atlas |
| Single blue eye | Unique glow pattern or shape |
| Robot body | Original silhouette |
| Friendly/approachable | Add distinctive quirks (antenna? markings?) |
| Compact size | Must work at 8" scale (cameos) AND full-size (streaming) |

## Usage Contexts
1. **Streaming persona** — Full-size, rigged for real-time
2. **Cinematic Sleep Stories** — Tiny (8"), cameo appearances, silent
3. **Brand mascot** — Logo variants, merchandise potential
4. **Social media avatar** — Profile pics, emotes
