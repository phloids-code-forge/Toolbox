## 🏗️ SITE ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY: "The Junk Drawer"
**Philosophy:** `phloid.com` is a curated chaos. A "Junk Drawer" of apps.
- **Dynamic Ranking:** The most popular/used apps float to the top visually.
- **Discovery:** Users dig through the "drawer" to find hidden gems.
- **Low Friction:** New ideas land in the drawer immediately. Polish comes later.

## 🆕 NEW PROJECT IDEAS (Jan 2026 Brainstorm)

### 📥 Phloid Mail (pip@phloid.com)
**Type:** Infrastructure / AI Agent
**Goal:** Auto-managed email presence with personality.
**Requirements:**
- **Infrastructure Options:**
    - *Option A (Free):* Cloudflare Email Workers (Serverless, $0).
    - *Option B (Easy):* Mailgun ($15/mo).
    - *Option C (Hard):* VPS Postfix ($6/mo).
- **Public Auto-Responder:** "The Snark Tank." Pip analyzes incoming public mail and sends contextually snarky replies to trolls/low-effort emails.
- **Ghostwriter:** Pip formats your rambling emails into blog posts.
- **Interface:** No standard webmail. Pip _is_ the client.

---

### 🧘 Meditation App
**Type:** Web App
**Concept:** Minimalist mindfulness tool.
**Vibe:** Calm, grounding, perhaps tied to weather/Sleep Scape.
**Status:** Pure Ideation.

---

### 🕶️ Blind IDE Challenge
**Type:** Skill Event
**Timing:** Tomorrow (2026-01-16).
**Goal:** Stress-test coding adaptability.
**Constraint:** User receives a "Blind" IDE setup. Must build something.

---

### 🌙 Sleep Scape
**Type:** Interactive Web App  
**Concept:** Client-side animated sleep/ambient scenes. No video files—pure code/animation.

**Themes:**
- 🏕️ Tent (Rain Storm)
- 🏖️ Beach House
- 🚀 Space Station (Nebula/Solar Flare)

**Key Features:**
- **Stochastic Loops:** Elements move based on RNG to prevent repetition.
- **Time Sync:** Lighting changes based on user's system time.
- **Diegetic Alarms:** Alarms integrate into the world (e.g., Space Station oxygen purge).
- **Privacy-First:** Local Storage only. Transparent data dashboard.

---

### 🎰 The Speakeasy (Hidden MUD)
**Type:** Secret Community Layer  
**Engine:** Evennia (Python)  
**Access:** Konami Code or hidden glitch trigger opens a terminal overlay.

**Setting:** "The Phloid Nightclub" — Cyberpunk aesthetic.

**Features:**
- NPC AI using cheap API calls (Gemini Flash).
- Text-based now, but architected for future 3D frontend (Godot/Three.js).
- Server sends JSON objects so frontend can be swapped without rewriting backend.

---

### 🏗️ Vibe Architect Curriculum
**Type:** Self-Education  
**Goal:** Master System Architecture without learning low-level code syntax.

**Method:** "Just-in-Time" Learning.
- Pip explains Architectural Patterns (SSOT, Normalization, Caching) *before* generating code.
- Focus on *why* systems are designed a certain way.

**Core Concepts to Learn:**
- Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
- Database Normalization
- Caching Strategies
- API Gateway Patterns
- Load Balancing
- Pub/Sub Messaging

---

### 🤖 Local Playwright Automation
**Type:** Backend Tool  
**Goal:** Automate daily weather website screenshots.

**Constraint:** MUST run locally (desktop/Raspberry Pi) to maintain residential IP.

**Architecture:**
- Script runs on user hardware → visits TV station websites.
- Saves timestamped screenshots to private "Evidence" folder.
- Syncs data to cloud database for Weather Wars scoring.

**Status:** Needs deeper discussion before implementation.

---

### 🎨 Web Design Expert Persona
**Persona:** "The Creative Technologist"

**Core Competency 1: Elegance**
- High-end UI/UX
- Typography, whitespace, "invisible" professional polish
- Perfect mobile responsiveness, fast load times

**Core Competency 2: Whimsy**
- Micro-interactions that delight
- Hidden easter eggs
- Satisfying button clicks
- Dynamic animations

---

### 🛠️ Software Style Guide (PHLOID_STYLE_GUIDE.md)
**Philosophy:** "The Vibe Architect"

- Code must be explained via logic flow first.
- **Data Integrity:** "Rock Solid" validation. Never guess.
- **Communication:** "No Fluff." Direct, honest assessments.
- **Naming:** User prefers `phloid` (lowercase, always).
- **Infrastructure:** Python preferred for backend. System Stability > Speed.

## 🔗 KEY SYNERGIES

### **Art Foundation → Everything**
- 250 Box teaches **perspective** → feeds into comic panels, 3D modeling, avatar design
- Color Theory → unlocks **palette consistency** across all visual work

### **Vibe Architect → All Code Projects**
- Understanding system design makes Weather Wars, Sleep Scape, and Music Lab more robust
- Prevents "Black Box Panic" when debugging

### **Blender → Avatar Forge + Content**
- Ducky3D loops = **motion graphics** for Content Channel
- Rigging practice = **cleaner avatar bones** for Avatar Forge

### **Weather Wars → Everything Technical**
- API patterns reused across Music Lab, Sleep Scape
- Data validation patterns ("Rock Solid") apply everywhere

### **Sleep Scape → Passive Income Potential**
- Client-side animation = low hosting costs
- Ko-fi tiers for custom themes

### **The Speakeasy → Community Building**
- Hidden community layer for superfans
- MUD "Builder" status as Ko-fi perk
